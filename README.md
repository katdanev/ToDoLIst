# ToDoList
java program for Sprint 1 Algorithms and Datastructure course


Description:
The goal of this project is to create a simple to-do list manager where users can add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view their list of tasks. Each user has their own to-do list, and each to-do list is represented as a single linked list of tasks. The users are stored in an array/arraylist. The project will demonstrate the use of arrays and single linked lists in Java.

Expectations and Functionalities:
1.	User Management:
1.	Ability to create users and store them in an array.
2.	Each user has a unique name.
   
2. Task Management:
1.	Ability to add tasks to a user's to-do list.
2.	Each task has a description and a completion status (completed or pending).
3.	Tasks are stored in a single linked list for each user.
   
3. Mark Tasks as Completed:
1.	Ability to mark a task as completed by updating its completion status.
   
4. View Tasks:
1. Ability to view all tasks in a user's to-do list, along with their completion status.
   
Implementation Details:

1.	Task class:
1.	Stores the description and completion status of a task.
2.	Includes a method to mark a task as completed.
   
2. User class:
1.	Stores the name of the user and their to-do list (a single linked list of tasks).
2.	Includes methods to add a task, mark a task as completed, and print all tasks.
   
4. TaskList class (single linked list):
1.	Represents the to-do list for a user.
2.	Includes methods to add a task, mark a task as completed, and print all tasks.
   
4. Main class:
1. Creates users and adds them to an array.
2. Adds tasks to users' to-do lists.
3. Marks tasks as completed.
4. Prints all tasks for each user.
